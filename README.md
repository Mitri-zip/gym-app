# Inspiration:

I built this project to level up my React and full-stack JavaScript skills by recreating a real gym management system for a friendâ€™s business
pushing myself to implement complex features like class bookings, membership tiers, and user authentication from scratch.

# What it Does:
Gym-app is a full-stack web application that provides users with a complete gym management experience. 
It allows members to purchase different membership tiers (Basic, Small Group, and Personal Training), sign up for special High Vibez community events, 
and register for classes based on their available passes. The system automatically tracks pass usage, and sends email confirmations

#How it was built: 
Gym-app combines React (with hooks) for the frontend and Node.js/Express with MongoDB for the backend. 
Key libraries like react-datepicker and date-fns handle class scheduling and date management, 
while MongoDB tracks users, memberships, and pass counts. 
The RESTful API connects everything, ensuring real-time booking validation and a smooth user experience.
